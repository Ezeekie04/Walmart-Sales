### 1. Data Files

- **`initial_dataset.csv`**: The raw dataset from Kaggle, containing features such as store, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
- **`predictions.csv`**: Contains columns for `Actual`, `Predicted`, and `Error` values, used for evaluating the Random Forest model.
- **`trend_analysis.csv`**: Preprocessed data for trend analysis of actual vs predicted sales over time.
- **`feature_importance.csv`**: Feature importance scores computed from the Random Forest model.
- **`aggregated_sales.csv`**: Aggregated sales data by store.

### 2. Notebook

- **`portfolio 3.ipynb`**: Contains the complete workflow, including:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training (Random Forest Regressor)
  - Error analysis and evaluation
  - Exporting data for visualization

### 3. Visualization

All visualizations were created in Tableau using the exported CSV files. Dashboards include:
- Actual vs Predicted Sales
- Trend Analysis Over Time
- Feature Importance
- Error Distribution
- Aggregated Sales by Store
